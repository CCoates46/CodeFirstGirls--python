# CodeFirstGirls--python

This is a project based on the game of Top Trumps utilising the Pokemon API.
I began by first hitting the end point and retrieving a random ID first, next I challenged myself to retrieve multiple random ID's and
to compare stats with an opponent and decide if I won, lost or drew in the game.
The final file, I created multiple rounds with a loop and recorded the overall game results and then wrote them to a text file.

I really enjoyed this project.
